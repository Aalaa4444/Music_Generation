# Music Generation with LSTM
This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to generate music in the form of MIDI files. It trains on a dataset of MIDI files and generates new music based on the learned patterns.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pretty_midi
- mido
- IPython

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-generation.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to generate music.
